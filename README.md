# DSA-Daily-Journey
**Description**:   Welcome to my daily journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms! This repository contains my solutions, explanations, and approaches to DSA problems tackled each day. Follow along or contribute as we explore topics essential for technical interviews and competitive programming.

# Repository Structure

**Problems by Day**: Each day has its own folder (e.g., Day1, Day2) containing that day's problem and solution.
**Topics Covered**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.

# Contents

    Problem Statement: A brief description of each problem.
    Approach: My thought process and approach to the solution.
    Code: Clean, commented code to understand the solution.
    Complexity Analysis: Time and space complexity for each solution.

# How to Use This Repository

    For Learning: Review each problem, attempt it on your own, then check the solution.
    For Interviews: Use it as a quick reference to brush up on key DSA topics.
    Contributions: Feel free to suggest new problems or optimized solutions.
